# Flink SQL Workbench Extension - Code Review Findings

## General Issues

- Documentation consistency: README and quickstart docs could be more concise and better cross-referenced.
- Error handling: Some commands catch errors but do not always provide actionable feedback.
- Type safety: Usage of `any` for error objects and results can be improved.
- Redundant comments and unused imports in several files.
- Configuration duplication and inconsistency between README and `package.json`.

## src/extension.ts

- Hardcoded defaults for gateway URL and other settings; should be centralized.
- Generic error handling (`error: any`) may hide useful details.
- Session creation/deletion commands lack user confirmation.
- Some commands are placeholders without implementations.
- Progress reporting increments are hardcoded.
- Results panel only shows last result for batch executions.
- Context keys like `workspaceHasFlinkSqlFiles` are set but not always updated.
- Webview HTML for job details is not sanitized.

## src/webview/editor.js

- Duplicate keywords in Monaco language registration (e.g., 'FOR').
- Basic SQL formatter may break valid SQL formatting.
- DOMContentLoaded handler does not always initialize editor if Monaco loads late.
- Errors in formatting/execution are only shown in status, not as dialogs.
- Use of global variables could be encapsulated.
- No accessibility features in webview.
- Formatting overwrites editor content without undo support.

## src/test/extension.test.ts

- Only a sample test is present; no actual extension functionality is tested.
- Commented-out import for the extension.
- No coverage for commands, providers, or error handling.

## package.json

- Some recommended extensions may not be strictly necessary.
- Configuration keys are duplicated or inconsistent with README.
- No explicit activation events defined.
- Only devDependencies listed; check for missing runtime dependencies.
- No icon specified for marketplace display.

## .vscode/extensions.json

- Minimal recommendations; could add more relevant extensions.
- No explanation for why each extension is recommended.

## vsc-extension-quickstart.md

- Some instructions reference deprecated extensions or APIs.
- No troubleshooting section.
- No link to main README.

## README.md

- README is very long; consider splitting into sections or wiki pages.
- Duplicate information in configuration and usage.
- No screenshots or images.
- No API reference or contribution guidelines.

## Summary of Issues to Correct

1. Improve error handling and user feedback.
2. Centralize configuration defaults and ensure consistency.
3. Remove unused imports and redundant comments.
4. Expand and improve test coverage.
5. Sanitize webview HTML and improve accessibility.
6. Refactor global variables in webview scripts.
7. Enhance SQL formatter or use a library.
8. Support multi-result display in results panel.
9. Add extension icon and activation events.
10. Update documentation for clarity and completeness.
11. Expand extension recommendations.
12. Ensure context keys are updated dynamically.
13. Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
14. Improve progress reporting.
15. Remove duplicate keywords in Monaco registration.
